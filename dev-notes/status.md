# Status

**Read this first** after a break or a cleared context. It answers "where is
this, and what should I do next" without needing to read the whole repository.

For the live view - which build steps are ticked, what git says, what has
drifted - run `progress` instead. This file is the slower-moving picture:
what has been verified, and what is known to be missing.

The `docs` skill maintains it.

## Where this stands

_Not started yet._

## Verified

What has actually been proven to work, and how it was proven. Not what should
work.

_Nothing yet._

## Open / not done

Known gaps, untested paths, and things deliberately deferred. **Be honest here** -
this section is the one that saves time later, and it only works if it is
complete.

_Nothing yet._

## Running it by hand

The commands behind the automation: how to build, test, and run this without the
scripts, and how to do by hand what CI does on push.

**Anything that only exists as automation is one broken pipeline away from
nobody knowing how to do it.** Write it down here.

**What CI does on push, by hand** (from the repository root, Node 26):

    npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
    npm run verify

`npm run verify` runs, in order:

    npx react-router typegen     # generate route types (gitignored, so CI needs this)
    npx tsc -b                   # typecheck
    npx biome check .            # lint + format check
    node --test                  # unit tests (**/*.test.ts)
    npx react-router build       # production build into build/

To reproduce CI exactly, run it from a fresh clone with no `.env` - that is how
it was proven on 2026-09-15 (commit `0ab3b35`):

    git clone <repo> /tmp/habre-ci && cd /tmp/habre-ci && npm ci && npm run verify

**Not run by CI** - browser tests, because they need a database:

    docker compose up -d && npx playwright install chromium && npm run test:e2e

## Recommendations

Judgment rather than fact - "if you pick this up later, do X". Kept separate from
what is verified above, on purpose.

_None yet._
